# ESP07_WiFiGarageDoor

This is USB powered and uses an analog IR range sensor (20 to 150cm) to detect door position on the top rail, and an HC-SR05 for the car, DC sink output for opener, OLED display, and DHT22 for temp and rh.
  
Note:  Pin 1 of the OLED is GND (these came from eBay, so I needed to use them for something).  
  
Here's [a small case](http://www.allelectronics.com/make-a-store/item/mbu-906/utility-case-2.74-x-1.99-x-0.83/1.html) that it fits nicely in.
