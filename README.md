# ESP07_WiFiGarageDoor

Based off the waterbed heater.  This is USB powered, has 2 analog IR range sensors (20 to 150cm) to detect the door and car, output for opener, OLED display, 1 or 2 more optional digital I/O pins with 5V and 3V3 exposed.  One I/O has a resistor divider for future use.  
  
The code is not complete yet, so things may change.  
Note:  Pin 1 of the OLED is GND (these came from eBay, so I needed to use them for something).  
  
Side switch is SKSCLBE010
